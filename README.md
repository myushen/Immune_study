# Immune_study
Identify known and new transcriptional modules that are shared between different immune cells.
 
I consider conventional CD4+ T cells as the orchestrators of immune flexibility, and so these are my first target cell to investigate. Id start with looking in all of your PBMC datasets for this population (tissue can come later).
Currently my genes to individually track (not combined) in each sample (see whiteboard photo) are:
Tbx21, Zeb2, Gata3, Rorc, Bcl6, Prmd1, Tcf7, Hif1a
 
These are the research questions Im interested in identifying:
1. What samples the expression of these factors peak in - healthy and disease/inflammatory.
2. In these same samples are these genes also expressed in other immune cells (co-ordinated transcription). Investigating B cells, Plasma cells, NK, DCs, CD8, ILCs, Macrophages, also other CD4+ cells like Tregs and Tfh, etc.
3. When these genes are expressed, what are the genes that are co-expressed with them. Other transcriptional regulators and cytokine signalling. 
4. How do these modules look in tissues - potentially what are the cell communication ligand-receptors that link these shared modules.
5. Potentially for ML, what is missing, are there other lead transcriptional regulators that drive other unknown modules.
